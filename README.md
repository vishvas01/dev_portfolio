## Getting Started

To get started with development, you can use the following commands:

```
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
yarn start

# Build the static files
yarn build
```

After running `yarn start`, your website should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can choose from 10 different colours provided by Chakra UI. Modify the `color` variable in the `App.js` file located in the `src` folder.

```
// Available Colours:
// blue, cyan, gray, green, orange, pink, purple, red, teal, yellow

const color = "pink";
```
